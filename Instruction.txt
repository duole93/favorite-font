Structure
[DONE] 1 Header with minor navigation (Logo and Catalog/Featured/Articles/About link list)
[DONE] 2 Nav with Major navigation / page-manipulation 
    (search, custom text, font-size, dark/light mode, grid/list mode, and reset)
[DONE] 3 Main section to contain the font cards
[DONE] 4 Font cards which display the Font Name, the font creator, the sample text, and an add button
[DONE] 5 Footer section with your developer information

Style
[DONE] 1 Sample text in each card should be displayed in the corresponding font
[DONE] 2 Buttons/links should be evident (make sure the cursor changes, etc.)
[DONE] 3 Implement a way to handle overflow from sample text in font cards, as the font size is adjustable

Functionality
[DONE] 1 Text typed into the custom text (type something) box should immediately change the sample text displayed in each font card
[DONE] 2 The sample text should return to the default sample if the input box (type something) no longer has any input (ex. input == "")
[DONE] 3 Font size chooser should have at least four sizes and should immediately change the sample text font size in each font card
[DONE] 4 Implement the clickable 'reset' icon on the far right of the major navigation; it should make the page appear as if the user reloaded the page (do not actually reload the page)
